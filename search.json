    "text": "The Human and Machine Learning (HaML) Lab is recruiting a PhD student this year, to start in Fall 2024. If you’re interested in human learning, machine learning, and neuroimaging, apply to work with Dr. Neal Morton through UWM’s Neuroscience PhD program! Read on for more specific information about completing a PhD in the HaML Lab.\n\n\n\nWe study how the brain uses cognitive maps to make sense of the world and guide decision making.\nCognitive maps, which organize structured knowledge, are thought to be critical for learning of the concepts and schemas that help us understand our world.\nWe use a combination of model simulations, learning tasks, and neuroimaging to better understand how the brain forms and retrieves information from cognitive maps.\nOur work has implications for understanding human learning, illuminating causes of cognitive disorders, and improving machine learning methods.\n\nYou can read previous publications from Dr. Morton to get a better sense of the lab’s research.\n\n\n\nThe lab has different focus areas examining behavior, neuroimaging measures, and theoretical work including computational modeling. PhD students can start in any area and learn additional skills from there, and not everyone necessarily has to be involved in every area.\n\nBehavioral studies examine learning of relationships that are thought to be organized within cognitive maps that help guide flexible reasoning behavior.\n\nExample paper (includes neuroimaging, but behavioral tasks are an important component): Representations of Temporal Community Structure in Hippocampus and Precuneus Predict Inductive Reasoning Decisions.\n\nNeuroimaging studies are used to examine neural representations of cognitive maps and how these representations relate to behavior.\n\nExample paper: Representations of common event structure in medial temporal lobe and frontoparietal cortex support efficient inference.\n\nTheoretical and modeling work examines the implications of cognitive map representations within a wide range of behaviors, including memory retrieval, reasoning, and decision making. Longer-term theoretical work will examine potential implications for memory consolidation, dreaming, and PTSD.\n\nExample paper: Concept formation as a computational cognitive process.\n\n\nPhD research will generally start by implementing a key study from the lab’s planned research program. The student will receive one-on-one guidance in collecting and analyzing data, presenting on the results at a national conference, and publishing in a peer-reviewed journal. After the first major project, the student will work with Dr. Morton to determine a more independent project that will fit with their interests and the lab’s research program, while continuing to receive training in critical research skills.\n\n\n\nResearch is multifaceted, and all students will receive training in various aspects of research. However, some experience is very helpful before starting a PhD, to start developing research skills and help a prospective student determine whether obtaining a PhD in neuroscience is right for them.\nSome experience and skills that are helpful to have:\n\nRelevant coursework in psychology, neuroscience, math, and statistics\nExperience in conducting psychological studies with humans\nProgramming experience with languages such as Python or R\nKnowledge of or experience with neuroimaging\n\nMost important, however, is to have a strong sense of curiosity and the focus and determination needed to answer difficult questions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the graduate courses offered through the Psychology Department, students will receive training through their work in the HaML Lab.\nThe specific training partially depends on the individual students and their interests; for example, some students may receive significant training and experience in modeling methods, while others may focus more on neuroimaging. However, there are core research skills that all students will receive training on:\n\nConducting literature searches\nDesigning rigorous tasks for studying human behavior\nImplementing studies using presentation software\nAnalyzing behavioral and neuroimaging data\nCode development best practices and software publishing\nData visualization best practices\nWriting and giving presentations\nScientific writing\nGrant writing\nPublicizing results to broad audiences\n\nDr. Morton believes strongly in providing formal training in all areas of research. He will provide comprehensive documentation and one-on-one training in each of these topics, to ensure that PhD students have the support they need to become capable independent researchers.\n\n\n\nIn addition to having frequent meetings about research, students will also regularly meet with Dr. Morton to discuss their larger career goals and the skills, experience, and connections needed to meet those goals. Dr. Morton supports students seeking different career paths and can make use of his connections with academics in many universities and industry connections in software development, data science, machine learning, and bioengineering to help students explore different research-related and technical career paths.\n\n\n\nSee the UWM Psychology PHD program website for instructions on applying. Application materials are due on December 1. If you’re planning to apply, it’s a good idea to contact Dr. Morton first to introduce yourself and say a bit about why you want to work in the lab. It is also helpful to attach a curriculum vitae if you have one. Dr. Morton can answer any questions you have about the program and research in the lab."

    "text": "The Python programming language has high-level advice to people developing Python code, called the Zen of Python, to try to explain what good code looks like. The following list is my attempt to make a similar set of principles for what good research looks like, based on my 17 years of experience. They reflect general principles rather than hard-and-fast rules.\n\nGet comfortable with being wrong and work hard to become less wrong.\nTesting multiple theories is better than attempting to confirm a single theory.\nPractical is better than purely theoretical.\nSteal methods and ideas from the best. Be generous when giving credit.\nOpen-source tools are better than closed-source tools.\nDevelop skills and tools that serve as force multipliers.\nResearch ethics come first.\nReplicate empirical results before relying on them to constrain theory.\nStatistical power is key.\nDocument all critical aspects of a project in writing at the outset and keep documentation updated throughout.\nStudy designs and code are guilty until proven innocent.\nReadability counts, in code, figures, and research reports.\nCommunicate with all stakeholders: advisors, colleagues, funding agencies, and the public.\nSimply publishing a PDF on a website is unlikely to have much impact by itself.\nWork with the larger scientific community to create greater impact.\nMake your work publicly available. Publish code, data, and detailed documentation.\nWhen communicating research, speak as plainly as possible.\nUse a range of methods to communicate research for different levels of expertise and interest.\nMeet people where they are and explain why they should care about your research.\nRead widely. Learn about things that aren’t immediately relevant to your research.\nWork together, but also work to find your own voice.\nBring your whole self to work. If the work requires compromising who you are, it’s not worth it.\nTake time off. It’s your right as a human being and will lead to better and more creative work anyway.\nBuild the career you want."
