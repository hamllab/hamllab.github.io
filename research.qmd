Below are summaries and visual abstracts of some of the lab's recent research. See the full papers for details. A full list of publications, with links to free access on PubMed for most papers, is available on the [publications](publications.html) page.

### Knowledge of related events becomes integrated during learning and predicts reasoning performance

A Wikipedia-based model of semantic relatedness predicted activity during learning that is related to integration of overlapping events [@2023_Morton].

### Statistical learning in hippocampus may help discover implicit structure in the world

Hippocampus and precuneus activity patterns reflect an implicit community structure that relates objects and correlate with inference based on community [@2022_PudhiyidathMorton].

### Cortical networks and hippocampus represent real-world knowledge of famous people and places

Using a model of semantic similarity based on Wikipedia articles, we found that overlapping but distinct networks reflect knowledge of people and places [@2021_MortonZippi]

### Memory reactivation simultaneously promotes formation of integrated and differentiated codes in hippocampus

Reactivation of related memories during learning promotes formation of integrated codes in CA1 and differentiated codes in CA2,3/DG, which predict inference [@2021_Molitor].

### Cognitive maps organize related experiences in terms of shared structure

When participants learn a series of similar relationships, hippocampal and cortical activation patterns realign to reflect the similar roles of different objects [@2020_Morton2].
