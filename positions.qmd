# Research Coordinator Position

## Position Description

The [Human and Machine Learning (HaML) Lab](https://hamllab.org) in the Department of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee seeks a full-time Research Intern to begin around May 2024. Lab studies will examine how human memory supports optimal decision making in both familiar contexts and new situations, using behavioral and neuroimaging data and model simulations. Responsibilities include conducting behavioral and neuroimaging studies, supervising and training undergraduate research assistants, and fostering connections with the broader Milwaukee community. This position is ideal for those interested in applying to graduate school and/or a career in experimental psychology or neuroscience, as it will provide hands-on training, a vibrant and diverse intellectual community within UWM's Department of Psychology, and the opportunity to present at conferences and co-author publications.
 
The position has a duration of 1 year, with potential for a 1-year extension. The successful candidate will work primarily on site at UWM's campus and at the Center for Imaging Research at the Medical College of Wisconsin, where scanning studies will be conducted. Individuals from all backgrounds are welcome to apply, and those from backgrounds unrepresented in science are especially encouraged to do so. Depending on the applicant's experience, the salary will range from $44,000 to $46,000.
 
The HaML Lab studies how humans acquire and apply knowledge to make informed decisions in a complex and uncertain world. We aim to develop a comprehensive theory of human learning that takes into account memory limitations, motivation, and uncertainty, while explaining how memories are formed and transformed through memory consolidation. We use a combination of behavioral methods from cognitive psychology and neural measures obtained using neuroimaging, which are used to inform development of neurally informed machine learning models that mimic human behavior and brain activity. We ultimately aim to have an impact beyond the lab by informing understanding of memory problems and memory-related disorders such as PTSD. The HaML Lab, which started in Fall 2023, is directed by [Neal Morton, PhD](people/nealmorton.html).
