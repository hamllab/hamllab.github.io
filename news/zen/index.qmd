The Python programming language has high-level advice to people developing Python code, called [the Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), to try to explain what good code looks like. The following list is my attempt to make a similar set of principles for what good research looks like, based on my 17 years of experience. They reflect general principles rather than hard-and-fast rules.

-   Get comfortable with being wrong and work hard to become less wrong.
-   Testing multiple theories is better than attempting to confirm a single theory.
-   Practical is better than purely theoretical.
-   Steal methods and ideas from the best. Be generous when giving credit.
-   Open-source tools are better than closed-source tools.
-   Develop skills and tools that serve as force multipliers.
-   Research ethics come first.
-   Replicate empirical results before relying on them to constrain theory.
-   Statistical power is key.
-   Document all critical aspects of a project in writing at the outset and keep documentation updated throughout.
-   Study designs and code are guilty until proven innocent.
-   Readability counts, in code, figures, and research reports.
-   Communicate with all stakeholders: advisors, colleagues, funding agencies, and the public.
-   Simply publishing a PDF on a website is unlikely to have much impact by itself.
-   Work with the larger scientific community to create greater impact.
-   Make your work publicly available. Publish code, data, and detailed documentation.
-   When communicating research, speak as plainly as possible.
-   Use a range of methods to communicate research for different levels of expertise and interest.
-   Meet people where they are and explain why they should care about your research.
-   Read widely. Learn about things that aren't immediately relevant to your research.
-   Work together, but also work to find your own voice.
-   Bring your whole self to work. If the work requires compromising who you are, it's not worth it.
-   Take time off. It's your right as a human being and will lead to better and more creative work anyway.
-   Build the career you want.
