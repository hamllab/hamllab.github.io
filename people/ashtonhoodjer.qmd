My name is Ashton Hoodjer, I am an undergraduate student at UW-Milwaukee. 
Initially I was an engineering student but after deciding that psychology is where my passions truly lie, I have found great success in the major. 
In the future I hope to find postgraduate programs and work hard to fulfill my goals in education, graduating in 2027. 
In my free time I enjoy basketball, going to the gym, keeping updated on current topics, and spending time with friends and family.
