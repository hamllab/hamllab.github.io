I have always been interested in the social sciences since I was young. Often, I would do small, often crude, experiments of my own as a kid to figure out how things work. Other times, I would think about the mess that I just created and how I could make it less of a mess next time I did it. Given this, I often get hindsight bias when thinking concurrently about my chosen field and my childhood pasttimes. 
When I'm not doing projects, I'm playing chess, painting, writting for fun, or reading.
