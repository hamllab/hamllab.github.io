I received my B.S. in Psychology from Brigham Young University, where I managed the Kirwan Memory and Decision Making Lab (2022–2024), worked as a research assistant in the Brain Imaging and Behavior Lab (2022–2024), and served as a teaching assistant for Psychological Statistics. 

My research interests center on learning and memory—particularly the relationship between attention and memory, and how these processes can be manipulated to enhance recall. I have explored these questions using both fMRI and behavioral methods. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy skiing, mountain biking, BBQ (hopefully competitively soon), and spending as much time as possible with my wife and daughter.
