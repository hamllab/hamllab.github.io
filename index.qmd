People are extremely skilled at recognizing patterns in the world and using knowledge
about these patterns to quickly adapt to changing circumstances. For example,
based on our past experience, we can learn to behave in very different ways at
the office, at a party, or on a date. However, the means by which our brains
organize and deploy our complex knowledge of the world remain mysterious. Using
human neuroimaging data, combined with modern approaches to machine learning, we
aim to develop a theory of learning and inference that can explain how we use
our experiences to make sense of our world.
